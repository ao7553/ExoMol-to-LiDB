# ExoMol-to-LiDB

A Python software suite for processing molecular line lists from the 
`ExoMol database <https://www.exomol.com/>`_ into standardised input files to populate the
`LiDB database <https://www.exomol.com/lidb>`_ of molecular radiative lifetimes.

ExoMol provides molecular data for spectroscopic studies of hot atmospheres. These data 
are widely used to model atmospheres of exoplanets, cool stars and other astronomical 
objects, as well as a variety of terrestrial applications. 

LiDB provides molecular vibrational and vibronic state radiative lifetimes, created with 
the aim of enabling radiative effects to be properly captured in low-temperature plasma 
models. Full details can be found in the 
`LiDB publication <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6595/aceeb0/meta>`_.

The code inside this repository is designed to be executed directly on the UCL ExoMol
*exoweb* server, which hosts the ExoMol database. The program will read each ExoMol line 
list and process it into compatible lifetime data to populate LiDB. This entails:

- Creating lumped vibrational states from the rotationally-resolved ExoMol energy levels 
  contained in the ExoMol .states file.

- Processing the .trans file(s) and determining partial lifetimes for transitions 
  between the lumped vibrational states.

- Calculating the total lifetimes of the lumped vibrational states by summing up all the 
  contributions from the partial lifetimes.

- Renormalizing the partial lifetimes to ensure they are consistent with the total 
  lifetimes. This step was necessary as LiDB only provides the five fastest decay paths 
  per lumped vibrational state (discussed below in more detail).

The original code was developed by Martin Hanicinec as 
`exomol2lida <https://github.com/ExoMol/exomol2lida>`_ and deserves much of the credit. 
However, the code required further development to be scientifically correct and work as 
intended. Much of my development was on the processing algorithm 
- ``exomol2lida/process_dataset.py`` and my changes are commented with *#ALEC*.

This documentation page compiles information to get up to speed and running.

Getting started
===============

- Clean virtual environment on the exoweb server.

- Clone the repo: ``git clone git@github.com:ao7553/ExoMol-to-LiDB.git``

- Create the ``config/config_local.py`` file. The contents of which should be

  .. code-block:: python

    from pathlib import Path
    EXOMOL_DATA_DIR = Path("/absolute/path/to/exomol3_data")
    # the directory with individual molecules

  This points to the data, and can be changed for testing on a local PC anywhere.

- Install dependencies: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

- Test the package if all ok: ``pytest`` will test all docstrings, integration tests and
  unit tests, ``pytest tests_integration`` and ``pytest tests_unit`` break down the
  testing.

- **Note**: The outputs for processed molecules are saved in the ``outputs`` directory.


Project structure
=================

The project structure is as follows. Parts of the project will be later discussed in
more detail.

- ``config`` package contains ``config`` and ``config_local`` (not under VCS) modules
  with some project-wide configuration options.

- ``exomol2lida`` package contains all the code for the actual data generation
  and processing.

- ``input`` folder contains the input files configuring the processing of individual
  molecules.

- ``output`` folder is where the data processing outputs are saved to. Contents of this
  folder (paths to) are needed by the data population script in the
  `lida-web <https://github.com/ExoMol/lida-web>`_. project.

- ``preferred_isotopologues`` is a package grouping some functionality for guessing
  which isotopologue for each molecule is likely the most abundant one, and should be
  a part of LiDB data. This is just a utility package and is not used implicitly by
  any other parts of the ``exomol2lida`` workflow.

- ``tests_unit`` and ``tests_integration`` are testing harnesses written for ``pytest``.

- ``process.py`` and ``postprocess.py`` are top-level scripts doing processing and
  post-processing for a single molecule.


Input files
===========

The input files located in the ``input`` folder are currently the following:

- ``input/mapping_el.py``
- ``input/molecules.py``

Let us start with the ``molecules.py`` input file.


``molecules.py`` input
----------------------

The main input file contains the configuration for each molecule that is supposed to
be processed by ``exomol2lida``. The structure of the ``molecules.py`` file is the
``dict`` with molecule formulas as keys and dictionaries with number of mandatory and
optional attributes, as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    molecules = {
        "molecule formula": {
            "mol_slug": "molecule slug",  # mandatory
            "iso_slug": "isotopologue slug",  # mandatory
            "dataset_name": "the name of the dataset",  # mandatory
            "resolve_vib": ["quantum 1", ..., "quantum n"],  # at least one of "resolve_*" needs to be given
            "resolve_el": ["quantum 1", ..., "quantum m"],  # at least one of "resolve_*" needs to be given
            "states_header": ["i", "E", "g_tot", "J", ..., "q_1", ..., "q_k"],  # if given, both "resolve_*" ignored
            "energy_max": int("maximal energy [eV]"),  # optional, if not present, all data are used
            "only_with": {"quantum": value},  # optional, if not present, all data are used
            "only_without": {"quantum": value}  # optional, if not present, all data are used
        },

        ...,

        "other molecule formula": {...}
    }

The ``molecule formula`` here needs to be a ``pyvalem`` compatible formula, but does not
need to be the same as the ExoMol formula (but generally will be, with exception
of distinguishing between isomers and different isotopologues of hydrogen).

It might be best to show an example:

.. code-block:: python

    molecules = {
        "CO": {
            "mol_slug": "CO",
            "iso_slug": "12C-16O",
            "dataset_name": "Li2015",
            "resolve_vib": ["v"]
        },
        "HCN": {
            "mol_slug": "HCN",
            "iso_slug": "1H-12C-14N",
            "dataset_name": "Harris",
            "resolve_vib": ["v1", "v2", "v3"],
            "only_with": {"iso":  "0"}
        },
        "HNC": {
            "mol_slug": "HCN",
            "iso_slug": "1H-12C-14N",
            "dataset_name": "Harris",
            "resolve_vib": ["v1", "v2", "v3"],
            "only_with": {"iso":  "1"},
            "energy_max": 5.0
        },
        "VO": {
            "mol_slug": "VO",
            "iso_slug": "51V-16O",
            "dataset_name": "VOMYT",
            "states_header": [
              "i", "E", "g_tot", "J", "tau", "+/-", "e/f", "State", "v", "Lambda", "Sigma",
              "Omega"
            ],
            "resolve_el": ["State"],
            "resolve_vib": ["v"],
            "only_without": {"State": "0"},
        },
        "HD+":{
            "mol_slug": "H2",
            "iso_slug": "1H-2H_p",
            "dataset_name": "CLT",
            ...
        },

        ...

    }

The mandatory ``"mol_slug"``, ``"iso_slug"``, ``"dataset_name"`` attributes identify
the data within the ExoMol ecosystem. The ``"resolve_el"`` and ``"resolve_vib"``
attributes need to exist as columns in the .states file for the given dataset and these
quanta will be resolved in the final lida data. All the other quanta columns in the .states
file will be lumped and averaged over. At least one of the ``"resolve_el"`` and
``"resolve_vib"`` attributes need to be specified for each molecule.

The ``"states_header"`` defines the names of all columns in the .states file for the
dataset, and needs to have the same length as the number of the .states file's columns.
Of course, the ``resolve_el | resolve_vib`` need to be subset of the ``states_header``.
The ``"states_header"`` is optional in the configuration, if not provided, the columns
are inferred from the .def file, if possible, or an error is raised. Therefore the
``states_header`` attribute serves as a workaround for inconsistent .def/.states files.

Finally, the ``"energy_max"``, ``"only_with"``, and ``"only_without"`` attributes
specify the filtering of the data, in the way that states with higher energy than
specified, states with quanta values given by ``only_without`` and all the states
*other* than with quanta values given by ``only_with``, will be completely ignored, and
their transitions will not be considered at all for calculations of the lifetimes
of the final lumped states.

This is shown on the ``"HCN"`` and ``"HNC"`` example, which produces two LIDA molecules
out of a single ExoMol dataset, each only considering states with one of the
isomers, denoted in the ExoMol dataset by the ``"iso"`` column in the .states file.

Similarly, the ``"only_without"`` parameter can be used to filter out some unphysical
or nonsensical states, such as was done for the ``"VO"`` example, which has a state
(in the .states file) with value ``"0"`` under the ``"State"`` column, which needed to
be ignored. This could be used filter out all the states (and transitions to and from)
with a certain value of some specified quanta. One application would be to filter out
all the states with some vibrational quanta with values ``"*"`` or ``-1``, which indeed
do exist in many ExoMol dataset. But this was such a common occurrence, that such
filtering is hard-coded into the algorithm and does not need to be explicitly defined
by the input configuration file.

The ``"HCN"`` isomers, as well as the ``"HD+"`` molecule are examples of the
resulting LIDA molecule formulas differing from the ExoMol molecule formulas. The
keys in the ``molecules`` dictionary specify the *LiDa* molecule names, which need to be
unique within the LiDa ecosystem, while the first three mandatory parameters for each
molecule define the path to the correct dataset within the *ExoMol* database.


``mapping_el.py`` input
-----------------------

The LiDB database requires ``pyvalem``
compatible formulas of species, isotopologues and states. For them to be constructed,
the electronic states *resolved* for each species need to take form of valid molecular
term symbols, which ``pyvalem`` can parse. This is often the case without any
intervention, often, when ExoMol dataset resolved electronic states, there exists a
``"State"`` column in the .states file, populated with values which are in the
``pyvalem`` compatible form already. In the cases where this is not the case, however,
a mapping between the ExoMol electronic states and the LiDB (``pyvalem`` compatible)
electronic state labels needs to be provided.

The structure of this input file is made clear by the following self-explanatory
example of the ``mapping_el.py`` input file:

.. code-block:: python

    mapping_el = {
        "SiH": {
            ("a4Sigma",): "a(4SIGMA-)",
            ("B2Sigma",): "B(2SIGMA-)",
        },
        "NaH": {
            ("X",): "X(1SIGMA+)",
            ("A",): "A(1SIGMA+)"
        },
        "CN": {
            ("X",): "X(2SIGMA+)",
            ("A",): "A(2PI)",
            ("B",): "B(2SIGMA+)"
        },

        ...

    }

In theory, there might be more than a single column of the ExoMol .states file
associated with the *electronic* state, all necessary to resolve for LiDB, which is
the reason for the keys of the mapping above being tuples. In all the examples above
(and indeed in all the datasets processed so far), however, there is only a single
column in the .states file describing the electronic state, which has been considered
important to resolve for the lumped LiDB states. That is why all the ``tuple`` keys in
the ``mapping_el`` dicts have only a single value. In the example above, the ``"X"`` and
``"A"`` as keys on the ``"NaH"`` molecule actually represent all the possible values
of the ``"State"`` column on the .states file for the NaH ExoMol dataset, where the
corresponding input in the ``molecules.py`` would be
``"NaH": {..., "resolve_el": ["State"], ...}``.


Output files
============

Running the ``exomol2lida`` algorithm (described further below) for all the molecules
defined in the input files will result in the output files saved into the ``output``
folder with a similar structure as:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tree output/

    output
    ├── ...
    |   ...
    ├── CN
    │   ├── meta_data.json
    │   ├── states_composite_map.py
    │   ├── states_data.csv
    │   ├── states_electronic.csv
    │   ├── states_electronic_raw.csv
    │   ├── states_vibrational.csv
    │   └── transitions_data.csv
    ├── CO
    │   ├── meta_data.json
    │   ├── states_composite_map.py
    │   ├── states_data.csv
    │   ├── states_vibrational.csv
    │   └── transitions_data.csv
    |   ...
    ├── ...


``metadata.json``
-----------------
This file compiles all the metadata about the processed dataset, as an example, the
following was recorded for the ``CN`` molecule:

.. code-block:: console
    $ nano output/CN/meta_data.json

    {
      "input": {
        "mol_slug": "CN",
        "iso_slug": "12C-14N",
        "dataset_name": "Trihybrid",
        "states_header": [
          "i", "E", "g_tot", "J", "unc", "tau", "g", "+/-", "e/f", "State", "v",
          "Lambda", "Sigma", "Omega", "Source", "E_Duo"
        ],
        "resolve_el": ["State"],
        "resolve_vib": ["v"]
      },
      "iso_formula": "(12C)(14N)",
      "version": 20210526,
      "mass": 26.0030740045,
      "processed_on": "2022-02-02 12:25:56.214840"
    }

The metadata file contains the original input file for the molecule exactly as was
when the dataset was processed, plus some more metadata belonging to the ExoMol dataset.
In particular, the version recorded might be used in some automatic management of
newly released ExoMol line lists and their *propagation* into the LiDB database.


``states_data.csv``
-------------------
This is a file recording the lifetimes and energies of all the newly defined *lumped*
states, generated by the ``exomol2lida`` algorithm from the original states from the
ExoMol dataset's .states file. The lifetimes are in [s] and the energies in [eV]. The
example for the CN molecule looks as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ nano output/CN/states_data.csv

    i,   tau,                    E
    0,   inf,                    0.00023
    1,   0.10943243874229817,    0.25345
    2,   0.057139791266185895,   0.50341
    3,   0.03905472113608493,    0.75011
    ...
    98,  1.4510310386401931e-06, 7.25698
    99,  0.33311171927799127,    7.26205
    100, 0.0001961755103469539,  7.27088

The ``i`` column gives the unique ids of the *lumped* states generated from the original
ExoMol highly resolved states.


``states_composite_map.py``
---------------------------
This file gives the mapping between the ids of the *lumped* states and the ids of the
*original* ExoMol states (from the first column of the .states file). Again, the example
for the molecule above would be

.. code-block:: console

    $ nano output/CN/states_composite_map.py

    data = {
        0: {1, 102, 203, ..., 27798, 27868, 27937},
        1: {...},
        ...
        99: {...},
        100: {101, 202, 342, ..., 5275, 5413, 5551}
    }

This mapping makes for easy checks which of the original highly resolved states belong
to each lumped state (or *composite state*).


``states_vibrational.csv``
--------------------------
This file specifies the resolved vibrational quanta per each lumped state, e.g.

.. code-block:: console

    $ nano output/CN/states_vibrational.csv

    i,   v
    0,   0
    1,   1
    2,   2
    ...
    98,  20
    99,  39
    100, 39

In this example, only a single column ``v`` exists, because input config for this dataset
would have been set as ``"CN": {..., "resolve_vib": ["v"], ...}``, but more vibrational
quanta will generally be resolved for polyatomic molecules, resulting in more columns, such
as columns ``i, v1, v2, v3`` for the ``HCN`` molecule for example.
For the datasets which do not resolve vibrational states, these files will not exist.


``states_electronic_raw.csv``, ``states_electronic.csv``
--------------------------------------------------------
These files specify the resolved electronic quanta per each lumped state. The raw file
simply gives the original values of the columns in the ``"resolve_el": ["q1", ...]``
input parameter. The second file reflects the mapping from ``input/mapping_el.py`` and
gives the ``pyvalem`` compatible molecular term symbols, such as

.. code-block:: console

    $ nano output/CN/states_electronic_raw.csv

    i,   State
    0,   X
    1,   X
    2,   X
    ...
    98,  B
    99,  X
    100, A

    $ nano output/CN/states_electronic.csv

    i,   State
    0,   X(2SIGMA+)
    1,   X(2SIGMA+)
    2,   X(2SIGMA+)
    ...
    98,  B(2SIGMA+)
    99,  X(2SIGMA+)
    100, A(2PI)

In the cases where the electronic quanta values from the ExoMol .states file are already
``pyvalem`` compatible molecular terms and no ``input/mapping_el.py`` entry is needed,
both the ``output/formula/states_electronic_raw.csv`` and
``output/formula/states_electronic.csv`` will exist and will simply be identical.
For the datasets which will not resolve electronic states, these files will not exist.
While the ``states_electronic_raw.csv`` is produced by the ``exomol2lida.process_dataset``
module, the ``states_electronic.csv`` is produced by the ``exomol2lida.postprocess_dataset``


``transitions_data.csv``
------------------------
The last output file contains the transitions between the *lumped* states with their
calculated partial lifetimes. The same example of the ``CN`` molecule gives

.. code-block:: console

    $ nano output/CN/transitions_data.csv

    i,   f,  tau_if
    1,   0,  0.10943243874229817
    2,   0,  1.2059110179290697
    2,   1,  0.059981920029654155
    ...
    100, 29, 56790.90109600513
    100, 30, 0.9100356742558192
    100, 31, 0.00029494955495862026

The ``i``, ``f`` values refer to the ids of the *lumped* states.


The ``exomol2lida`` algorithm
=============================

In this section, the main state-lumping algorithm is briefly described verbally. The
algorithm follows these steps:

1.  Filter the original states from the .states file. This is where the input parameters
    ``energy_max``, ``only_with`` and ``only_without`` come in, see the *inputs* section.
    All the original states which do not survive this filtering will be completely
    ignored for the further calculations.

2.  Define the lumped states, create mapping between the original state ids and the lumps.
    Each lumped state is uniquely identified by the set of distinct values of the columns
    defined by the ``resolve_el`` and ``resolve_vib`` in the input file. In the example
    case of ``{..., "resolve_vib": ["v1", "v2", "v3"], "resolve_el": ["State"], ...}``,
    each lumped state is a collection of distinct values of the ``State, v1, v2, v3``
    columns from the ExoMol .states file. Each lump will consist of a number of original
    ExoMol states characterised with the same resolved quanta, but generally with different
    values under *other* columns, and other quanta, such as "+/-", "J", etc. A mapping
    is created between the lumped indices ``i`` and the original states indices ``i_orig``,
    ``i -> {i_orig}``

3.  Assign energies to the lumped states. Within each lump, the lowest-J states are
    identified and the energy of the lump is set to be the average of the original
    resolved states with the lowest J number, weighted by the ``g_tot`` total
    degeneracies.

4.  Lump the transitions and calculate the partial lifetimes of the lumped transitions.
    First, all the in-lump transitions are ignored and not used in any way in the
    calculations. Also, any transitions from and to a non-existing lump (such as to
    and from the original states that did not survive the filtering within the state
    lumping process, either too high energy, or regarding the ``only_with``, ``only_without``
    parameters) are completely ignored.
    If ``i``, ``f`` are the indices of the lumped states and ``i_orig``, ``f_orig`` are
    indices of the filtered original states from the .trans file, the partial lifetimes
    of each *lumped* transition ``i -> f`` is calculated as

    .. math::

        \tau_{i \to f} = \mathrm{avg}_{f_\mathrm{orig} \in f} (\tau_{i \to f_\mathrm{orig}}),

        \frac{1}{\tau_{i \to f_\mathrm{orig}}} = \sum_{i_\mathrm{orig} \in i} A_{i_\mathrm{orig} \to f_\mathrm{orig}}.

    Here, ``A`` refers to the einstein coefficients from the original .trans file.

5.  Calculate the total lifetimes of the lumped states, as

    .. math::

        \frac{1}{\tau_i} = \sum_{f} \tau_{i \to f}.

The algorithm described above is implemented in the ``exomol2lida.process_dataset``
module inside the ``DataProcessor`` class. The class is well documented and the
docstrings and the in-line comments serve as the best source of documentation and
usage. A the end of the processing workflow, most of the output files (discussed above)
are created. Apart the ``DataProcessor``, there is also the
``exomol2lida.postprocess_dataset.DatasetPostProcessor`` class, which handles the
conversion between electronic states as are in the ExoMol database, and ``pyvalem``
compatible molecular term symbol labels expected by the LiDB database.


The top-level scripts
=====================
Two top-level script exist which trigger the whole workflow. Assuming there exist an
input entry for molecule, e.g. ``"H2O"`` in the ``input/molecules.py`` file, the
calculation of the LiDB data for this molecule can be run by

.. code-block:: bash

    python process.py H2O

Similarly, the data can be post-processed (after processing finished) aby running

.. code-block:: bash

    python postprocess.py H2O

This assumes that if electronic states are resolved for this molecule, they either
can be parsed automatically by the ``DatasetPostProcessor``, or the
``input/mapping_el.py`` input file has defined the mapping to the valid molecular term
symbols.

Both can be run together by

.. code-block:: bash

    python process.py H2O --postprocess

If anything goes wrong, hopefully the error message will give a hint on what happened.
The processing and post-processing workflow can also be run on all the molecules found
in the input files, by running

.. code-block:: bash

    python process.py all --postprocess
